Cortex tries to solve a common problem frequently encountered by SOCs, CSIRTs and security researchers in the course of threat intelligence, digital forensics and incident response: how to analyze observables they have collected, **at scale, by querying a single tool** instead of several?

## Hardware pre-requisites
Cortex uses a Java VM. We recommend using a virtual machine with 8vCPU, 8 GB of RAM and 10 GB of disk. You can also use a
physical machine with similar specifications.
